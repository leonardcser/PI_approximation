<a name="goal"></a>
## Goal
The main goal of this library is to create a easy and fun way to learn to code in Java. Concepts vary from package managment, to game structure, events and algorithms.

<a name="features"></a>
## Features
- Keyboard events
- Mouse hover events
- Mouse click events
- Sound
- Custom sized window
- Fullscreen mode
- Terminal state save and restore
- System.err logger
- Smart System.out.print()
- Custom colors for Cells
- Custom colors for Pixels
- And much more customisation...

<a name="todo"></a>
## Todo
- [ ] create Youtube series how to use
- [ ] add java doc
- [ ] simplify use
- [ ] add areas
- [ ] add sprites
- [ ] add simple geometric shapes  
- [ ] optimizse performance  
...

## Cells vs Pixels
A Cell is the outerclass of a Pixel. It contains a x and y position on the Canvas, a Pixel instance and a priority (use for drawing).  
A Pixel contains a char, a background color and a forground color. Using half block chars, it allow to draw perfectly square pixels on the Canvas.

In order to draw anything, cells or pixel must be requested from Canvas.java

## How to use (in current state)
1. Create new package in /application
2. Create new class overriding Application.java
3. Create new "states" package in this new package
4. Create new abstract class in "states" package overriding State.java
5. Create a class for each state of the application in "states" package overriding "YourApplicationState".java (abstract class)

#### This is an example of how the file tree would look like:
<pre>
.
└── 📦 src/com/leo/application
    └── 📦 "yourapplication"
        ├── "YourApplication.java" ............ overrides Application.java
        └── 📦 states
            ├── "YourApplicationState.java" ... overrides State.java
            └── "YourState.java" .............. overrides "YourApplicationState.java"
</pre>

6. Add a new instance of the Application in [Loop.java](src/com/leo/application/Loop.java) main method
