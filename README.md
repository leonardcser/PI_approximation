<a name="goal"></a>
## Goal
The main goal of this library is to create a easy and fun way to learn to code in Java. Concepts vary from package managment, to game structure, events and algorithms.  
My idea is to create a youtube playlist explaining these concepts while creating an application or game.


<a name="features"></a>
## Features
- Keyboard events
- Mouse hover events
- Mouse click events
- Sound
- Custom sized window
- Fullscreen mode
- Terminal state save and restore
- System.err logger
- Smart System.out.print()
- Custom colors for Cells
- Custom colors for Pixels
- And much more customisation...


<a name="todo"></a>
## Todo
- [ ] create Youtube series step by step how-to
- [ ] add java doc
- [ ] simplify use
- [ ] add areas
- [ ] add sprites
- [ ] add simple geometric shapes  
- [ ] optimise performance  
...


<a name="cells-vs-pixels"></a>
## Cells vs Pixels
A Cell is the outerclass of a Pixel. It contains a x and y position on the Canvas, a Pixel instance and a priority (use for drawing).  
A Pixel contains a char, a background color and a forground color. Using half block chars, it allow to draw perfectly square pixels on the Canvas. (`â–€` and `â–„` instead of `â–ˆ`)


In order to draw anything, cells or pixel must be requested from Canvas.java

## How to use (in current state)
### Note
I am currently woking on this project, so no official JAR version is avaible for the moment.  
However, you can stay up to date by making this repo as starred and for the moment, you can download a JAR version here:
```console
curl -o jTengine.jar https://github.com/leonardcser/jtengine/raw/main/out/production/jTengine.jar
```

### Preliminary
1. Add JAR file to your java project

### Steps
1. Create new package in /src
2. Create new class overriding Application.java in this new package
3. Create new "states" package in this new package
4. Create new abstract class in "states" package overriding State.java
5. Create a class for each state of the application in "states" package overriding "YourApplicationState".java (abstract class)

#### This is an example of how the file tree would look like:
<pre>
.
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“¦ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ App.java (main class)
    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“¦ "yourapplication"/
        â”œâ”€â”€ "YourApplication.java" ............ overrides Application.java
        â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“¦ states/
            â”œâ”€â”€ "YourApplicationState.java" ... overrides State.java
            â””â”€â”€ "YourState.java" .............. overrides "YourApplicationState.java"
</pre>

6. Create App.java and add a new instance of the Application in it
